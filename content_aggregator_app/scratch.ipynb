I can't believe $200 bt headphones can sound this good and I have wired headphones that cost 4 times more  ( denon d7100 ) but my daily drivers are Fostex th-x00 with Denon da 300usb dac / amp . I also have Beyedynamic dt 770 , Fostex t50rp mk3 and few others . One thing I did was I replaced pads with velour pads from Aliexpress for $10 that fixed comfort issue and sound . With stock pads bass was out of controll and while I consider myself basshead it have to be clean , not boomy and nicely controlled and do not overpower mids and high end. Replacement pads from AliExpress fixed it so now these sound really , really  good . I also considered Technics a800 and from what I read they sound similar to yamaha and have ability to equalize them but cost 30% more and bought and returned Akg k371bt because they sound flat and boring and have many issues and bought and kept Skulkcandy crusher evo refurb for $100 as backup that sound surprisingly good once you run hearing test and they adjust sound and  use 5% bass boost .\n",

I have the Sony XM3s and they are extremely comfortable even with glasses, I can only imagine the 4th and 5th generation being just as comfortable. The Momentum 4s are pretty much just as comfortable, so you can't go wrong with either choice, ANC and sound quality is probably more important.\n",
