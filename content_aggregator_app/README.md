# Working Title: Seek
## Description
Basic idea here is to create an application that will collect information about a given topic from multiple sources. This will be from websites such as Reddit, YouTube, Wikipedia, and Google Scholar. Results will be displayed in a list format by website source.

## Design Brainstorm
- GUI with tkinter
- APIs or web crawler? Both?
- Top 5 results from each
- Begin with easy sources such as YouTube and Wikipedia
- List format contains links to media
